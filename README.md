The assignment I chose to do was My Search Engine. I was able to search through many .txt files using a given Filepath/Directory and using the built in methods such as .listfiles() and .exists() i was able to check each text file one by one for the words the user entered into the GUI. 

I split all the words the user entered into a string array and also split all the text files into a string array, checking if a string in the array was equal to the word the user entered and then returned the result and stored it in an array list. I used a built in method to sort the array list and return the strongest match at the top. I then appended the lists to a JtextArea in the GUI.

I also checked for similar words using the .startswith() method, for example doc would return the similar word doctor .The user can specify the search space by entering the the Filepath that contains the text files they wish to search.
